# Enough

This design is to bring awareness of what is going on in our society and how to to prevent it from happening.
These are the names of sexual assaults and rapes victims. Most of them committed suicide, others are still missing.
The design is purposely left uncompleted because an ideal society is one in which people should not worry about how these issues, where these atrocities would not occur.
The Names file contains the names of the victims by state.
The HashMapCode file contains diverse names of the victims of sexual assaults by states. It sorts all victims by states and put them in a HashMap.
The OuputFiles are different ouput of all victims by state.
The WorldCloud uses the name's victims to form the word ENOUGH.
